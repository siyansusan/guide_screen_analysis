# Guide Pair Screen Analysis

Code used to bin reads with deletions and analyze the set of guides responsible for the deletions.

## Requirements

To run analysis code, you will need to obtain a set of Python packages [AHAB](https://github.com/siyansusan/AHAB.git).
In order to use these packages, you will have to add them to the PYTHONPATH variable as following, 
where *\<dirname\>* is the directory with the above packages. 

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="<dirname>:$PYTHONPATH"
```
